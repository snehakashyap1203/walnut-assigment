# create-paths

[![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Create a graph like structure with nodes and edges and calculate the duration between positions along the graph.

## Example
```javascript
var createPaths = require('create-paths');

var traverse = createPaths( [
    ['a', 'b', 1],
    ['a', 'c', 0.5],
    ['c', 'b', 0.25]
]);

// { duration: 0.75, path: [ 'a', 'c', 'b' ] }
console.log(traverse('a', 'b')); 

// { duration: 0.85, path: [ 'a', 'c', 'b' ] }
console.log(traverse({ from: 'a', to: 'b', location: 0.1 }, 'b')); 
```

## Usage

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/create-paths.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-paths)

#### `var traverse = require('create-paths')(map);`

When this module is passed a `map` it will return a function which can be used to traverse the network of underlying nodes to find the path from one location to another.

`map` should be an a two dimensional array. Each element of that array should describe a segment of a path.

So in the example:
```
[
    ['a', 'b', 1],
    ['a', 'c', 0.5],
    ['c', 'b', 0.25]
]
```

`['a', 'b', 1]` describes that you can go from `'a'` to `'b'` in `1`.

#### `var info = traverse(from, to);`

The returned `traverse` function can be used to find the path and duration between two locations.

`from` can be a simple string which correlates to the original map passed in. Or i can describe a location between two locations using the following notations:

```
{ from: 'a', to: b: 'b', location: 0.1 }
```

Which states we're between `'a'` and `'b'` at `0.1`.

`to` must always be a string.

`info` will be `null` if a path cannot be found between two locations. If path can be found it will be in the form:
```
{
    duration: 0.5,
    path: [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]
}
```

Where `duration` is how the total distance/duration defined by the original map passed in. `path` is the name of the nodes that will be visited.
